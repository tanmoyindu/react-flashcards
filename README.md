Hey everyone,

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project: React Flashcards! ðŸš€

## What are React Flashcards?

React Flashcards is a web application designed to help you study and review information in an interactive way. Each flashcard consists of a question on one side and the corresponding answer on the other. By clicking or tapping on a card, you can easily flip it to reveal the answer, allowing for a seamless and efficient learning experience.

## How to Get Started:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the React Flashcards repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.

Customize Your Flashcards: Open the project in your favorite code editor and add your own flashcards.

Run the Application: Once you've customized your flashcards, run the application locally using npm start or yarn start!

Deploy to Production: When you're ready to share your flashcards with the world, deploy the application to your preferred hosting platform and share the link with your friends, classmates, or colleagues.
